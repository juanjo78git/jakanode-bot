# Jakanode-bot Project

A robust and versatile Telegram bot built with Python, designed to streamline automation and enhance user interaction.

## Installing and Setting Up

To set up *jakanode-bot*, follow these steps to create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

### Create a Virtual Environment

First, create a virtual environment in the project's root directory. 
You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
This will create a folder named `venv where the virtual environment will be stored.

### Activate the Virtual Environment

Before installing dependencies, activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
After activation, your terminal prompt should change to indicate that the virtual environment is active.

### Install Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This command will install all the necessary packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file for `jakanode-bot` to work properly.

### Verify the Installation

After installing the dependencies, you can verify that everything is installed correctly by checking the installed packages:
```bash
pip list
```
This will show a list of installed packages, and you should see the required ones from the `requirements.txt` file.

Now, your environment is ready for running jakanode-bot and executing commands like database migrations or running the bot itself.

- `WEBHOOK_BOT_KEY`: Path to the private key associated with the SSL certificate.

#### Internationalization (i18n) Settings

- `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE`: Default language code used by the bot (e.g., `en`, `es`).

#### Database Configuration

- `DB_NAME`: The name of the SQLite database file.
- `DB_PATH`: Directory where the database file is stored.

#### Admin User Configuration

- `ADMIN_USER_ID`: The Telegram user ID of the bot administrator.

#### Logging Configuration

- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`).

#### Service and Deployment

- `SERVICE_NAME`: The name of the bot service.
- `USER`: The system username running the bot.
- `DEV_DIR`: The directory where the bot is located during development.

#### How to Use the `.env` File

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root.
2. Copy and paste the example content above.
3. Replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration.
4. The bot will automatically load these settings when it starts.

For further assistance, refer to the bot's documentation or contact the maintainer. ðŸš€

## Database Migrations

To manage database schema changes and ensure your database is up-to-date with the latest structure,
*jakanode-bot* includes a migration system. This system allows you to automatically apply any pending migrations,
including creating new tables or altering existing ones.

### Creating SQLite3 Database

To create the SQLite3 database, run the following command from the root directory of the project. 
If the database doesn't exist, it will be automatically created:

```bash
sqlite3 db.sqlite3
```
Make sure that the database-related variables in the `.env` file are correctly configured. 
These variables define the database connection settings that *jakanode-bot* will use.

### Running Database Migrations

To execute all pending database migrations and apply any necessary changes to your database, 
run the following command from the root directory of your project:

```bash
python -m database.migrate
```
And verify that the changes have been applied successfully by checking the database:

```bash
sqlite3 db.sqlite3
```
```sql
.headers on
.mode column
SELECT * FROM migrations;
.tables
```

## Translations
To generate and update translations, follow these steps:

1. **Extract new text strings**: 
    First, extract all the translatable text strings from the source code into a .pot file. 
    Run the following command from the project's root directory:
    
    ```bash
    xgettext -L Python --from-code=UTF-8 -o i18n/locales/messages.pot $(find . -path ./venv -prune -o -name "*.py" -print)
    ```
    This command searches for all Python files `(*.py)`, excluding the `venv` folder (if you have a virtual environment), 
    and generates a `messages.pot` file containing all the text strings.

2. **Merge the new strings into existing `.po` files**: 
    If you already have translation files for languages like Spanish and English, 
    you need to merge the newly extracted strings into the corresponding `.po` files. 
    If the `.po` files don't already exist, create empty ones for each language before merging:

    ```bash
    touch i18n/locales/es/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po 
    touch i18n/locales/en/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po
    ```
    Then, merge the new strings into the `.po` files:

    ```bash
    msgmerge -U i18n/locales/es/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po i18n/locales/messages.pot 
    msgmerge -U i18n/locales/en/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po i18n/locales/messages.pot
    ```
3. **Generate the compiled `.mo` files**: 
    After updating the `.po` files with the translations, 
    compile them into `.mo` files that can be used by the project at runtime:
    
    ```bash
    msgfmt i18n/locales/es/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po -o i18n/locales/es/LC_MESSAGES/messages.mo 
    msgfmt i18n/locales/en/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po -o i18n/locales/en/LC_MESSAGES/messages.mo 
    ```
    The `.mo files are the ones jakanode-bot will use to load translations at runtime.
